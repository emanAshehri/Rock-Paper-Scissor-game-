# Rock-Paper-Scissor-game
In this project, we have to apply our Python and object-oriented programming skills to build a program that plays the game of Rock Paper
Scissors.there is classes that represent the game and its players. the computer players that follow various different strategies, as well
as a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.
## How to play it ?
The game of Rock Paper Scissors is played throughout the world, The game has two players. In a single round of the game, each player 
chooses one of three moves, or "throws" â€” rock, paper, or scissors. and reveal their moves at the same time. If both 
players picked the same move, there is no winner. Otherwise, rock beats scissors; paper beats rock; and scissors beat paper.
